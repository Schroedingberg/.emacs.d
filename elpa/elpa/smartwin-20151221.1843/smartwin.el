;;; Commentary:

;; Smartwin is a window for shell buffers, temp buffers and etc.

;; This minor mode let shell like buffers share a window, called smart window,
;; the smart window is always at the bottom of emacs window. Besides that, when
;; point move into or out the smart window, it will be enlarged or shrinked
;; automaticly.
;;
;; To use smartwin, place this file to load path and add this to .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'smartwin)
;; (smartwin-mode 1)
;;
;; or run M-x smartwin-mode to toggle it.
;;
;; To switch between buffers of smart window, you can bind keys like:
;;     (define-key smartwin-mode-map (kbd "C-c s") 'smartwin-switch-buffer)
;;
;; Then try run M-x shell or or eshell, if you want to show more buffers in
;; smart window, please customize variable: smartwin-buffers.

;;; Change Log:

;;; TODO:
;; 1. Use new addvice functions to do advice.

;;; Code:
