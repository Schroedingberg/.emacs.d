Abstract = {{The high-pressure hydraulic hoses are components used in operation of
   various kinds of machines and machinery. Operational reliability and
   safety of the pressure hoses belong among the most important
   requirements influencing functionality of the hydraulic circuits, which
   are installed in a wide range of technical equipment. Users of the
   machines equipped with the hydraulic hoses are aiming to avoid emergency
   situations caused by possible failures of the pressure hoses. Therefore
   it is necessary to know and to describe damaging processes arising in
   the hoses. The up to now used testing methods are insufficient at
   present because they are not able to offer necessary information about
   the damaging processes as well as about the degradation changes
   occurring in the hoses during their current operation. Therefore in
   order to describe the degradation processes in more detail, new,
   progressive diagnostic methods are developed nowadays. One of the most
   frequently applied modern diagnostic methods is the computer industrial
   tomography. This method can be utilised for analysing of the
   high-pressure hoses, however it is necessary to verify whether this
   method is suitable for application in this area with regard to the
   individual structural components of the rubber hoses. This paper
   presents fracture analysis of surface for a rubber steel reinforced hose
   using the industrial computed tomography Zeiss Metrotom 1500. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Solid-state NMR methods were used to characterize the filler
   distribution in rubber blends and domain size of thermoplastic
   vulcanizates (TPV). Correlation between filler content and magic angle
   spinning (MAS) C-13 and H-1 NMR signal linewidth was established, and
   filler content in each component of the rubber blends was determined. In
   IIR/BR and BIMS/BR blends, carbon black enriches in BR phase. Comparison
   of the carbon black enrichment in both blends suggests that BIMS has a
   slightly stronger interaction with fillers than does IIR. Results
   obtained from AFM analysis were compared with NMR observations. Spin
   diffusion NMR was demonstrated to be useful for quantifying the amount
   of interfacial component in TPV. Its advantages - ease of quantification
   and high sensitivity for smaller domains - make it a complementary
   approach to microscopic techniques for elastomer morphology
   characterization.}},

However, \{NMR\} datasets present a unique challenge during preprocessing due to differences in phase offsets between individual spectra, thus complicating the correction of random dilution factors that may also occur. We show that simultaneously correcting phase and dilution errors in \{NMR\} datasets representative of metabolomics data yields improved cluster quality in \{PCA\} scores space, even with significant initial phase errors in the data.

abstract = "A new algorithm for automatic phase correction of \{NMR\} spectra based on entropy minimization is proposed. The optimal zero-order and first-order phase corrections for a \{NMR\} spectrum are determined by minimizing entropy. The objective function is constructed using a Shannon-type information entropy measure. Entropy is defined as the normalized derivative of the \{NMR\} spectral data. The algorithm has been successfully applied to experimental 1H \{NMR\} spectra. The results of automatic phase correction are found to be comparable to, or perhaps better than, manual phase correction. The advantages of this automatic phase correction algorithm include its simple mathematical basis and the straightforward, reproducible, and efficient optimization procedure. The algorithm is implemented in the Matlab program ACME—Automated phase Correction based on Minimization of Entropy. "

wird die unbehandelte Probe zwischen zwei zusätzlichen verlustfreien 
Isolierschichten in den Meßkondensator eingebracht. Dadurch wird im 
Unterschied zur {\"u}blichen Methode die Reproduzierbarkeit von 
Meßergebnissen gewährleistet. Durch eine eigens entwickelte 
Modellfunktion läßt sich dieses modifizierte System vollständig 
beschreiben. Eine Auswertung von Meßergebnissen anhand dieser 
Modellfunktion liefert Parameter, die Informationen hinsichtlich 
der inneren Struktur von Mischungen beinhalten. Ein Vergleich der 
Ergebnisse f{\"u}r unterschiedliche Rußsorten zeigt, von welchen 
Einflußgr{\"o}ßen die innere Struktur abhängt.

abstract="Nmrglue, an open source Python package for working with multidimensional NMR data, is described. When used in combination with other Python scientific libraries, nmrglue provides a highly flexible and robust environment for spectral processing, analysis and visualization and includes a number of common utilities such as linear prediction, peak picking and lineshape fitting. The package also enables existing NMR software programs to be readily tied together, currently facilitating the reading, writing and conversion of data stored in Bruker, Agilent/Varian, NMRPipe, Sparky, SIMPSON, and Rowland NMR Toolkit file formats. In addition to standard applications, the versatility offered by nmrglue makes the package particularly suitable for tasks that include manipulating raw spectrometer data files, automated quantitative analysis of multidimensional NMR spectra with irregular lineshapes such as those frequently encountered in the context of biomacromolecular solid-state NMR, and rapid implementation and development of unconventional data processing methods such as covariance NMR and other non-Fourier approaches. Detailed documentation, install files and source code for nmrglue are freely available at                   http://nmrglue.com                                  .

abstract = "The internal structure of carbon black particles considerably influences the optical behavior of the material, apart from the shape and agglomeration state of the primary particles. In this paper the correlation between internal structure and spectral behavior of carbon black is investigated experimentally. The carbon blacks were produced by resistive heating of graphite electrodes and condensation in a cooling gas atmosphere. The internal structure of the primary carbon black particles was investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, 13C \{NMR\} spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The primary particles were found to consist of bent or plane structural subunits. The \{UV\} π−π* absorption feature of the produced carbon blacks varies in position between 196 and 265 nm depending on the state of bending of the graphene layers in the subunits of particles and/or the dimensions of the plane graphitic microcrystallites and the incorporation of hydrogen. The different curvature radii of the graphene layers or the sizes of microcrystallites can be summarized by an integral dimension like the ratio of sp2/sp3 hybridized carbon atoms. In the mid-infrared spectral region, the absolute value of the absorption coefficient κ is dominated by a continuous absorption due to free charge carriers which are also influenced by the ratio of sp2/sp3 hybridized carbon in the primary particles. The appearance of prominent bands is related to the existence of functional groups, like C–Hn, CO and/or C–O–C. "

Abstract = {{Dipolar filters select H-1 magnetization according to local dipolar
   dephasing, which corresponds to site mobility in systems with
   heterogeneous molecular mobility. Combined with a conventional exchange
   experiment, it is usually applied to polymeric samples exhibiting
   structures on the nanometer length scale associated with a strong
   dynamic contrast. There, the resulting H-1 nuclear spin diffusion
   experiment yields the size of the structure. When the same experiment is
   applied to homopolymer melts exhibiting a weak dynamic contrast and
   dynamic heterogeneities on significant shorter length scales, the
   recorded magnetization decay is in agreement with decays expected from a
   heterogeneous nanostructure. However, dipolar filters actually can also
   select mobile parts of the repeat unit, e.g. the end of the alkyl side
   chains and the subsequent magnetization transfer then can occur via
   cross relaxation due to non coherent zero-quantum transitions (nuclear
   Overhauser effect, NOE). The difficulties of distinguishing these two
   cases are examined and it is demonstrated that NOE experiments
   exploiting magnetization selection via the dipolar filter allow
   quantifying the local dynamics of the side chains. This opens new
   possibilities for measurements of local dynamics in non isotopically
   labeled homopolymer melts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},
