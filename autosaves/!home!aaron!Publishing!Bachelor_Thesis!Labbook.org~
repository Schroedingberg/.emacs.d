**** FTIR-ATR Measurement of Samples
***** Aim of the experiment: 
     Getting a brief idea of the structure of the compounds in the rubber samples and additive samples
     provided by Imatech.
***** Measurement parameters
     FTIR with ATR (Germanium crystal) was used. Background correction between each two measurements.
     If not further specified, each sample has just been put on the stage without further preparation.
     An ATR correction was executed for each dataset.
     Settings:

***** Samples Measured:
      - Unirez pure
	Measured twice
      - P18 Anti static
      - Sylvarez
	- With Sylvarez the platform could not be closed completely because the crystal would burst under the force
	- Second measurement executed, got even less signal than in the first one
	- A third measurement with crushed sample has been done, which yielded much more signal
	- ATTENTION: There is a file called Rubber 2.0, that is actually Sylvarez 
      - Dyna purge

      - Twaron powder
	Measured twice

      - Carbon black 5303
	Named Rubber 6.1 by accident

	  Due to the different geometry and elasticity
	  of the pieces of rubber, there might be differences concerning the exact position
	  of the pieces in the sample space. This can cause deviations that blur the results.

**** Sample preparation of Unirez sample for SSNMR
     The Unirez beads were placed on top of the rotor vessel and placed in an
     oven at 150 °C to melt the resin into the rotor.

**** Sample preparation of Unirez
     Unirez molten at 150°C has flown into the rotor. The outside surface of the rotor is partly coated with Unirez.
     Also the rotor is too full to put the cap onto it.
     
:Marion:
Sample Unirez was packed by melting it into the rotor (bit by bit) in an oven at 150 °C.  The sample first did not spin,
that cap was checked and found damaged, and changed for a non-damaged one. The sample then only spun at ~900 Hz. In an attempt to re-arrange the sample inside the rotor, 
it was heated at 60 °C under MAS (~850 Hz). After ~1h at 60 °C the rotor had slowly accelerated to ~980 Hz. 
It was decided to run a different sample overnight and try to spin the rotor up again the next day.
Different sample preparation for Unirez (melting smaller chunks at 180 °C), and sample preparation for other samples, are reported in Aaron's labbook.

:END:






     
***** Cleaning of the surface 
      The outer surface has coarsely been freed from the Unirez-Rubber with a surgical blade. The rotor was clutched with
      tweezers during this process to avoid the risk of injuries.
***** Gaining of space for the capacity
      A drill was used to remove the excess rubber from the tube in order to make insertion of cap possible.
      The cap was inserted

     Dyna purge pellets have been cut into pieces with scalpel and placed in a highspeed rotor.
     The highspeed rotor with the Dyna purge pieces in it was then placed in an oven at 180°C.
