***  (2005). Understanding Nmr Spectroscopy. Chichester, West Sussex PO19 8SQ, England: Wiley.
     
**** Chapter 2
    - NMR spectrum is a plot of intensity of absorption or emission on the vertical axis against frequency on horizontal axis
    - Position of lines in Unit "ppm" which refers to the chemical shift scale because frequencies are proportional to
      magnetic field strength --> To compensate differences, the chemical shift is used --> Standardization
    - It will probably be necessary to convert between field strength and chemical shift
    - In experiment, only one isotope is measured at a time
    

***** Chemical shift scales
      - First step: Agreeing on a reference compound, for 1H and 13C it TMS
      - Position of a peak is specified by measuring its frequency separation from the reference peak and then dividing
	this by the frequency of the reference peak --> Field dependence cancels out

	#+BEGIN_SRC python
	import sympy
	nu, nuref  = sympy.symbols("nu nuref")
	delta = (nu-nuref)/nuref
# To convert from chemical shift to frequency just transform so that you get a Hz in both sides

	#+END_SRC

      - It looks like the "ppm" is not an actual unit because in the calculation only the corresponding power to ten is used


***** Receiver reference and offset frequency
      - Not understood what this is actually, should ask Marion
      - Receiver reference frequency can be set by the operator
***** Linewidths, lineshapes and integrals
      - Peaks must be separated from each other to deliver useful information
      - NMR experiments on complex molecules are primarily limited by the linewidths of the resonances involved
      - If separation falls below linewidth, lines can no longer be distinguished, which I think is bad for evaluation
***** Scalar coupling   (J coupling) (so far only valid for weak coupling)
      - J coupling between nuclei is mediated by chemical bonds is therefore useful in finding out which nuclei are
	close to another
      - Presence of coupling causes multiplets in the spectrum
      - Example: If to half spin nuclei are coupled, the resonance from each spin splits symmetrically about the chemical
	shift into two lines, called a doublet
      - Each doublet is split by the same amount, coupling constant J, of which the value is independent of the field strength
      - Basic idea behind: Spin half nucleus can be in up or down state of spin
      - The two lines of the doublet are separated by J_12 and placed symmetrically about the chemical shift
***** Tree diagrams
      - If there are couplings present to further spins, the form of the multiplets can be predicted using tree diagrams
      - These are practiced a bit on paper
      - If you introduce a third spin to a doublet that is coupled to the first spin with J_13 you get a four line
	multiplet, a doublet of doublets
      - Assumption made: Branching to the left reduces frequency of the line, branching to the right increases it
	- Based on this, the frequencies of each of the four lines of the doublet of doublets can be determined
	  like $\nu_{10} = \nu_1 - 0.5*J_{12}-0.5*J_{13}$ (exercised on paper)

***** Weak and strong coupling
      - Coupling is weak if frequency separation of two peaks is much higher than the coupling constant J_12
      - Coupling between different isotopes is always weak
      - If frequency separation is in the same dimension as the coupling constant one has strong coupling
      - Strong coupling disturbs frequency and intensity of the lines are disturbed in comparison to the weak coupling 
	prediction
      - This might cause a roofing effect: The multiplets peak intensity profile mimics the profile shape of a roof
      - Also the middle point of a line can become different from the chemical shift
      - Full analysis of strong coupling spectra can become very complex and is mostly automated
      - The book is therefore limiting the used examples to weak coupling
     


***** The basic NMR experiment
      1) Relaxation delay $t_{r}$, spins come to an equilibrium
      2) Short bust, about 20 $\mu s$, of high power RF is applied. This excites a signal called free induction decay.
      3) The FID is then recorded for a time called the acquisition time $t_{acq}$, usually more than about 50 ms
      4) Fourier transformation
	 Since the FID from one scan is too weak, the experiment is repeated n times, which makes the signal n times stronger,
	 while the noise, being a random signal only gets about $\sqrt{n}$ times stronger.

**** Chapter 3
     
***** The problem with the energy level approach
      - Quantum mechanics does not say that a molecule must be in one of the energy levels
      - If we measure the energy of a molecule, the obtained value will always corresponf to one of the energy levels
      - Actually an energy difference is measured
      




****** Wavefunctions and mixed states
       - It is important to make a distinction between a molecule actually being in one of the energy levels and the molecule
	 appearing to be in one of those states
       - Each energy level has a different wavefunction
       - The wavefunction does not need to be one associated with an energy level
       - The wavefunction for a molecule is generally a mixture of the wavefunctions associated with the energy levels
	 This is often called a mixed state or superposition state
       - Mixed states are important in NMR, in contrast to IR and UV, because in nuclei, any states are not easily perturbed
	 and therefore are observable




****** Energy levels in NMR
       - Frequencies of lines in an NMR spectrum can always be predicted by thinking about allowed transitions between energy
	 levels


******* Wavefunctions
	- $ \phi (r) = e^{-ar} $

	  - with r: distance from electron to nucleus

	  - a: known constant



******* Eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of operators
	- Operator [acting on] Eigenfunction = Eigenvalue * Eigenfunction
	- If we measure the value of some observable, the result will always be one of the eigenvalues of the operator
	  wich represents this observable
	- Concretely: If energy of a system is measured, the result must be one of the eigenvalues of the operator for energy
	  It is these eigenvalues which are the energy levels of the system 
	  



******* Hamiltonians and angular momentum
	- Constructing Hamiltonians is not within the scope of learning NMR, so the needed Hamiltonians are just given in
	  the book
	- $\hat{H} _{one~spin}= -\gamma \cdot B_{0}\cdot \hat{I}_{z}$
	


******* Eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $\hat{I}_{z}$
	- Number of eigenvalues of the angular momentum (z-component) is specified by quantum number I, called the
	  nuclear spin angular momentum quantum number, also known as spin quantum number
	  $I \in \mathbf{N} $  or $I \in  \{x:\frac{x}{2}~ where~ x \in \textbf{N}\}$
	- The operator  $\hat{I}_{z}$ has (2I+1) eigenfunctions, each of which is characterized by another quantum number
	  $m\in[-I,+I]\land m\in\mathbf{N}$
	- For spin half nucleus $\hat{I}_{z}$ has just two eigenfunctions, characterized by $m = +\frac{1}{2}$ and $m = -\frac{1}{2}$
	- Therefore one has the eigenvalue equations of $\hat{I}_{z}$ as $\hat{I}_{z}\Psi_{m}=m\hbar\Psi_{m}$

*** Frihart, C. ({2004}). Specific adhesion model for bonding hot-meltpolyamides to vinyl. {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADHESION AND
**** Adhesion models:
     No matter what bonding type is present, a good wetting of the surface is required. This is in turn antiproportional to
     viscosity and surface energy.
     Concerning adhesion of polyamides to vinyl, no correlation to viscosity of polyamides has been mentioned in patents,
     it is assumed that dynamic wetting is not the most important factor in such an experiment.
     
     Moreover, polyamides bond to smooth as well as to
     rough vinyl substrates. Thus, because a mechanical
     interlocking model does not explain adhesion very well,
     we need to consider a chemical interaction model.
***** Mechanical 

***** Chemical

**** Understanding of a typical hot-melt polyamide
     
***** Most of the mass of a typical dimer based polyamide is based on the dimer fraction (60 % - 80 %)
      Dimer portion contributes very amorphous and non-polar character to the polymer
      Moreover, dimer-based polyamides usually involve
      a 9- to 12-carbon diacid feed to raise the softening point
      and impart the strength of a more crystalline nylon.
      Polyamides are often made from two or more diamines
      to impart strength, flexibility, and sufficient open time.
      Linear aliphatic diamines, such as ethylenediamine and
      hexamethylenediamine, impart hardness and strength.
      Longer chain diamines, such as dimmer diamine,
      provide flexibility as a result of fewer amide groups in
      the resulting polyamide. Certain diamines, such as
      polyether diamines, can provide good low temperature
      properties. Where one diamine is piperazine or a similar
      diamine, the polyamide is softer as a result of fewer
      hydrogen bonds between the chains

***** Rheology
      A second stage of wetting occurs as the molten
      adhesive is cooling into a solid. Since the initial
      temperature of the adhesive is high for only a short
      time, there is insufficient time for the adhesive to flow
      into all the pores as could be expected under equilibrium
      temperature conditions. It is known that not all dimer-
      based polyamides have the same open time, i.e., the time
      for the adhesive to become solid [7,10]. The longer the
      open time the more likely the polyamide is to wet the
      surface prior to solidification.



      The other rheological factor is related to properties of
      the solid adhesive rather than the molten adhesive.
      Researchers have observed that bonds are often stronger
      if the modulus of the adhesive is similar to that of the
      substrate. The rationale is that less stress is concentrated
      at the interface if the adhesive and substrate are not
      highly different in modulus. A stiffer adhesive would
      cause greater stress at its interface with the substrate as
      the substrate is flexed, and the greater stress could
      exceed the bond strength of the adhesive to the
      substrate. Since piperazine incorporation reduces the
      internal hydrogen bonding of polyamides compared to
      the use of mono-substituted diamines, these polyamides
      generally have lower moduli. The hypothesis is that the
      lower moduli of piperazine-derived polyamides are
      closer to that of vinyl. Although most piperazine-
      derived polyamides have lower moduli than many other
      polyamides, some non-piperazine-derived polyamide
      formulations have lower moduli and do not bond to
      vinyl [9]. In fact, polyamides from dimer diamine have
      moduli and elongations similar to those of piperazine
      polyamides, but they show very low vinyl bond strength.
      In addition, flexibility (modulus) of vinyl is dependent
      on the amount of plasticizer added. The flexibility of
      vinyl does not influence which polyamides bond to vinyl
      and which do not. Thus, low stiffness of the polyamide
      does not appear to play a major role in this specific
      adhesion.

***** Conclusion
      For all of these
      theories of adhesion the adhesive is assumed to have
      sufficient wetting properties to develop contact at the
      molecular level contact, at least in spots. Hot-melt
      polyamides made from primary diamines do not form
      strong bonds. The data do not fit for explanations
      involving mechanical bonding, rheology, and solubility
      parameters. The mechanical interlock mechanism is not
      likely on the bases that adhesion does not depend on the
      roughness of the vinyl surface and that hot-melt
      adhesives do not penetrate the roughness well because
      of their high molecular weight and fast solidification.
      Vinyl- and non-vinyl-bonding polyamides are not
      distinct based upon either their flow properties or their
      moduli, as would be required by two rheological models.
      Calculated solubility parameters are not able to
      distinguish polyamides on the basis of whether or not
      they bond to vinyl. However, a model based on acid-
      base interaction between the vinyl and adhesive fits with
      the available data. This model relies on the reduced
      internal bonding of the polyamide for the amides made
      from secondary diamines compared to those made from
      primary diamines. Those tertiary amide groups that are
      not tied up in internal bonds are free to be proton
      acceptor groups for bonding to the proton-donating
      vinyl resins. This model, in which free proton acceptors
      are required for bonding to vinyl, not only explains the
      adhesion of polyamides made from secondary diamines
      but also fits with the adhesion to vinyl for poly(ester-
      amides).
      The acid-base interaction model explains the here-
      tofore unexplained specific adhesion to vinyl of
      polyamides made from secondary diamines compared
      to the lack of adhesion of polyamides made from
      primary diamines. This is not meant to imply that
      rheological and cohesive energy density factors are
      not important for good adhesion. Rather, these factors
      are unsatisfactory explanations of the improved adhe-
      sion observed with polyamides that are made from piperazine.

**** Things from abstract that sound interesting
     - ssNMR to characterize filler distribution in rubber blends
     - Correllation between filler content and MAS $^{13}C$ and $^{1}H$ NMR signal
       linewidth
     - In IIR/BR and BIMS/BR blends, carbon black enriches in BR phasec

     - Spin diffusion NMR useful for quantifying amount of interfacial component in TPV
    

**** Introduction
     - It has been known that MAS peaks become broader for samples filled with carbon black
       - This is the result of restricted polymer segment motion
     - Broadening by magnetic susceptibility effect has been consideres insignificant
     - This relationship has been used for study of the filler partitioning problem
     - Correlations between filler content and NMR peak broadening are established, then
       filler content in individual phases is  predicted on basis of this broadening
     - Spin diffusion NMR is used to determine domain size in these polymers and results are
       compared with AFM
     

**** Experimental section
     - $^{1}H$ 500.13 MHz
     - $^{13}C$ 125.75 MHz
     - For filler partitioning stury,
       a single $^{1}H$ pulse program was used for acquisition of $^{1}H$ Spectra.
     - Single $^{13}C$ pulse followed by high power $^{1}H$ decoupling for $^{13}C$spectra
     - MAS speed for both isotopes : 5 kHz
     - Recycle delay 5 s for $^{1}H$ and 10 s for $^{13}C$
     - Temperature = 80 °C
     

***** Spin diffusion study
      - $^{1}H$T$_{2}$ filter-diffusion cross polarization pulse sequence was used
      - A 180 ° pulse was placed in the middle of the T$_{2}$ filter to refocus chemical shift
      

**** Results and discussion
     - In MAS experiments of polymers, lineshapes change with filler content
     - Effect of carbon black content MAS lineshape can be
       utilized to probe partitioning of fillers in blends
     - For a rubber molecule the peak broadening is only a function
       of its distance to nearby fillers
     - Consequence (assuming that filler is homogeneously distributed):
       - The NMR signal width is a function of rubber content in one domain

       

***** Domain size in thermoplastic vulcanizates
      - Spin diffusion NMR widely used to obtain domain size information in ... polymers
      - It uses the difference in molecular mobility in the various phases in the sample to create a
	magnetization gradient, which allows nuclear spin diffusion to occur
      - This enables calculation of domain size
      - Suitable subjects for SDNMR seem to be compounds with a soft and a rigid phase $\Rightarrow$ TPV


****** Carbon black peak broadening could be proportional to effect of carbon black  on physical properties
       - Compare R5&6 with Unirez
       - Only line broadening not spin diffusion

***** Difficulties of SDNMR
      - Problems with detecting large domain sizes 
      - $^{1}H$  diffusion is limited by $^{1}H$ T$_{1}$ relaxation $\Rightarrow$ 0.5 to 2 s for semicrystalline polymers
      - Diffusion coefficient is in the order of 0.1-1 \si{\nano\square\metre\per\milli\second}
      - Rigid phase is often not completely rigid
      

***** Diffusion
      - The data show a well-defined diffusion process, which at the first sight seems surprising considering the broad
	distribution of domain sizes in TPVs
      - Reason: When most polypropylene domains are much bigger than what the current spin diffusion experiment
	can reach, the diffusion behavior is not highly sensitive to the domain size distribution

     - Zero filled to 8192 dp and processed with 50 Hz Lorentzian line broadening
       and 0.005s Gaussian broadening


**** Experimental
     - Spin lattice relaxation in the
     rotating frame values  measured 
     with variable spin lock pulse sequence. The T 1 q H values
     were used together with the total signal intensity acquired
     between 300 and 50 ppm to calculate the observability
     of carbon in each sample using the cross polarisation
     (CP–C obs ) and direct polarisation (DP–C obs ) pulse sequences
     (Baldock and Smernik, 2002). The relative allocation of sig-
     nal intensity to eight regions (alkyl 0–45 ppm; N-alkyl/meth-
     oxyl 45–60 ppm; O-alkyl 60–95; di-O-alkyl 95–110 ppm; aryl
     110–145 ppm; O-aryl 145–165 ppm; amide/carbonyl 165–
     190 ppm and ketone 190–215 ppm) was determined after
     reallocating signal intensity from spinning side bands back
     to their parent resonances (Baldock and Smernik, 2002). The
     relative signal intensities obtained from the CP and DP spectra
     were used in conjunction with a MMM (Baldock et al., 2004)
     to estimate the molecular composition of the organic mate
