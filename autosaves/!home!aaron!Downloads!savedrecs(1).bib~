Abstract = {{In the last two decades, Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR has created its
   own niche in studies involving photosynthetic membrane protein
   complexes, owing to its ability to provide structural and functional
   information at atomic resolution of membrane proteins when in the
   membrane, in the natural environment. The light-harvesting two (LH2)
   transmembrane complex from Rhodopseudomonas acidophila is used to
   illustrate the procedure of the technique applicable in photosynthesis
   research. One- and two-dimensional solid-state NMR experiments involving
   (13)C- and (15)N-labeled LH2 complexes allow to make a sequence-specific
   assignment of NMR signals, which forms the basis for resolving
   structural details and the assessment of charge transfer, electronic
   delocalization effects, and functional strain in the ground state.}},
