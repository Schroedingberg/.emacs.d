**** Getting a working holiday visa for Australia		     :TRAVEL:
     Our professors gave us the advice, that the easiest way of getting a short term visa for Australia would
     be a working holiday visa. We were not able to refute this, so we decided to give it a try and get one.
     The procedure, if you are perfectionist and careful as I am, may take about two hours. There are a lot of
     questions about health and law concerns (my favourite was the question if I had ever been accused of human trafficking,
     genocide or torture), but for an average student who is about to write his bachelor thesis, the answer is almost always
     no (I am neither sick nor criminal).
     Of course you should make sure that you enter everything correctly. I paid about 400 € for the application, which in
     my opinion is a lot of money, especially if you consider that there can´t be that much work involved.
     I am saying this, because getting the actual visa went so fast that I actually did not recognized it happening.
     I immediately received two emails, one confirmation of my application and one message saying that my visa had been
     granted. As I was thinking that this was just a double confirmation, I have been waiting quite long for my visa.
     In fact, I only found out I had got it yet, when my father asked me to show him the emails I had received.
     This was the first time I actually read the attached document and found out that the visa had been waiting for me 
     to read for about three months in my mailbox.

**** One day before the flight					     :TRAVEL:
     We have got our visa, passports, international bank account (of course with enough money on it) and our tickets.
     We have managed to get perfect presents for our hosts and we have packed our stuff (it was a fight to stay below
     the weight limit).
     We had a little caffeine-rehab to avoid a cold turkey during the flight (if you are a serious coffee drinker you
     should not underestimate this - the headache is really cruel).

**** One day after our arrival					     :TRAVEL:
     We are in the apartment of Patrice and Marion. Yesterday we arrived and Patrice fetched us from the airport,
     we went by train, which was a little bit exhausting with all the luggage but all in all it went well and he told
     us a lot about Sydney in general and Parramatta in particular. After arriving at their apartment,
     we had a little rest and then went to take a look at the University. It was interesting and I shall describe it more
     precisely, but I think it is better to do that in a dedicated text.
     Marion and Patrice invited us for lunch and dinner this day, so we seldomly hungry.
***** The flying experience
      The flight with was much better than expected. Air India has a very comfortable economy class. I particularly
      liked the indirect, color changing lighting and the screens that could be switched off.
      Of course we had taken precautions to avoid the jetlag as far as possible. We had bought sleeping masks and
      earplugs (Kelana, if you are interested in having a really good one) which did a very good job. We would be really
      happy later on to have slept quite a bit.
      Another positive thing about Air India was the food. If you can bear very spicy food, it is really good.

**** Finally found an apartment (yesterday)
     After basically about five days of desperate search for a proper accomodation, we finally got something via flatmates.com.
     Jason sent us a message with the location and a phone number and I called him and got an appointment for an inspection
     the same day. We liked the room and the apartment very much, its clean and tidy, big enough and well furnished.
     More information on this will follow when we have moved in there, which will be on Saturday.
     Parallel to looking for accomodation, we have managed almost all the organizational work at the University that
     was required for our projects to be started. We have been provided with staff cards, keys, have been shown around,
     had security introductions for the labs we are going to use and have made first contact with the team.
***** What we did today <2016-02-04 Thu> 
      Today we started the day with some workout in the gym that is included in the tenement Marion and Patrice live in.
      After that we had lunch in an all-that-fits-on-your-plate asian fast food restaurant and opened a bank account at
      Westpac to be able to pay our rent.
      Then we relaxed a little bit and in the evening we had dinner with Marion.

**** Today we moved in at our new accomodation
     It is, as said, pretty clean, Jason and Alicha are nice, Pumpkin the cat as well.
     We bought quite a lot of groceries to be able to prepare food there.
     EDIT: We bought the basic stock at ALDI, which is much cheaper than the two big supermarkets in Australia!
     Yesterday, we spent the day at the University, studying the probable contents of our projects.

**** Stress is starting
     We have spent a lot of time in the University the last days. Melissa assisted Pauline, a french Ph.D. student at
     the CE and I took some IR spectra of the samples I got from Joel.
     We also read a lot.
     The mentality of the people is unsatisfying. The seem not to be interested in precisely specifying our projects,
     which makes most of all Melissa suffer, because everything she knows so far sounds extremely boring to her.
     Additionally, the samples she is supposed to work with have not arrived yet, so she can´t even do something to really
     drive her work forward. This is really frustrating.

***** Weekend / Leisure
      On sunday we went to Sydney the first time. It was really hot. We could have some cheap food that tasted alright and
      the market was beautiful.
      Obviously pearls are quiet cheap around here, Melissa bought two pairs of pearl earrings for 24 $ total.
      We went to the botanical garden that day which was a nice place to be at but which also offered the thrill
      of observing slightly poisonous spiders in trees. (They were called something with golden orb spinning spiders)
      On monday after the University we had dinner with the team at Marion and Patrices place. That was very amusing and
      we had a lot of food. They (especially Patrice) are much better in cooking than in project management.

**** It has been a long time
     It is really hard to maintain the diary. There are many distractions, both leisure and project related.
     It feels almost wrong to invest time in writing down what happens during the day, because I always feel like I am
     not doing enough for my bachelor thesis.
